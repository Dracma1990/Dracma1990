## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy working in teams and solving problems in web and mobile application testing using tools such as Jira, Python, Android Studio, Postman, SQL, and Selenium WebDriver, all with the aim of contributing to the strategic mission of IT companies.

I like to stay constantly up-to-date. I recently completed a technology bootcamp at TripleTen, where I was able to put my knowledge into practice using these tools in various scenarios that transformed into highly educational projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for my first job as a Jr. QA Engineer
